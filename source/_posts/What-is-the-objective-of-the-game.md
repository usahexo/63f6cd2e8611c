#  What is the objective of the game?

Many video gamers debate the objective of the game. Some say it’s to win, others say it’s to have fun. The objective of the game is actually both. Winning is just one way to have fun.

How do you win? The definition of winning may be different for each person, but there are generally agreed upon ways to win a game. The most common way is to reach the final goal or objective before anyone else. This could be beating all the levels in a game, defeating a final boss, or capturing all the flags in a multiplayer match.

Other ways include gaining more points than anyone else, completing all the tasks first, or being the last one alive in a game of elimination. There are many ways to win and it varies from game to game. As long as you complete the objectives set before you, you can consider yourself the winner.

So what’s the point then? Some people would say that reaching the final goal is the only point and anything else is secondary. Others would say that playing for fun is the objective and winning is just a bonus. There really isn’t a correct answer here. Different players enjoy different aspects of gaming.

Some people love trying to complete every task and beating every level as fast as possible. Others just want to relax and take their time exploring every nook and cranny of the map. Some people enjoy competing against others online while others would rather play by themselves. Ultimately, it’s up to each individual player to decide what they find fun and enjoyable about gaming.
