#  Red Numbers Most Common in Roulette 

Casinos have been using roulette wheels since the late 18th century, and along with it various betting systems. The game is based on random number generation, and each spin of the wheel is independent of any other spin. This means that the odds of any particular number being hit are the same on every spin.

Despite this, some numbers are hit more often than others. In fact, red numbers are by far the most common, accounting for almost two thirds of all spins. Black numbers are next most common, accounting for just over a quarter of all spins. This is followed by green (0) and yellow (00) numbers, which together make up less than 5% of all spins.

There’s no one definitive explanation for why red numbers are so much more common than the other colours, but there are several theories. One possibility is that players tend to bet on red numbers more heavily than on other colours, which increases their likelihood of being hit. Another possibility is that the ball sometimes bounces differently off the roulette wheel depending on the colour, which leads to a higher number of red balls landing in pockets.

Whatever the reason, if you want to increase your chances of winning at roulette, it’s important to be aware of these trends and bet accordingly.

#  Number Seven Most Likely to Hit in Roulette 

Although roulette is ultimately a game of chance, there are some numbers which seem to come up more often than others. If you're looking to up your chances of winning, then playing at a table that features number seven may be the way to go.

Statistically, number seven is the most likely to hit on a roulette wheel - appearing approximately 20% of the time. So if you're looking for a number with a bit more potential payoff, then this could be it.

Of course, while playing at a table with number seven may give you a better shot at winning, it also comes with increased risk. So make sure that you're comfortable with the stakes before sitting down.

#  Black Numbers Dominate in Roulette Rolls 

A mathematician has found that black numbers are more likely to come up in roulette rolls than red numbers.

This isn't particularly surprising, as black numbers account for 37 of the 38 possibilities on the roulette wheel (remember, there is both a 0 and a 00 slot on the wheel). But it's still an interesting factoid to know.

The mathematician, who goes by the name of "barycentric," analyzed thousands of roulette rolls and found that black numbers came up about 51.27% of the time. Red numbers, meanwhile, only came up about 48.73% of the time.

This difference may seem small, but it can have a significant impact over time. If you were to play roulette long enough, you would statistically expect black numbers to come up slightly more often than red numbers.

#  Odd Numbers Most Likely to Come Up in Roulette Games 
Mathematicians have long been fascinated by the odd and even numbers. In a roulette game, the odds of any specific number coming up are always the same. However, there is a difference between the odds of a particular number being drawn and the odds of that number being hit. The probability of any number coming up is 1 in 36, but that doesn't mean you'll hit it every 36 spins. The odds of any particular number being hit are 18 out of 36, or 50%. 

The distribution of these probabilities is what fascinates mathematicians. While it's always 1 in 36 for any individual number to come up, over time each individual number will come up more or less often. The most likely odd numbers to come up in roulette games are 3, 5, 7, and 11. These four numbers account for 25% of all outcomes on a European wheel. 

Interestingly, when you look at even numbers, things get a bit more complicated. There is no clear consensus as to which even numbers are most likely to come up in roulette games. Some mathematicians claim that 2 and 4 are the most likely, while others maintain that 6 and 8 are more likely to appear. Still others believe that all even numbers have an equal chance of turning up. 

What is clear, however, is that while any given number has the same chances of appearing on any given spin, certain numbers are more likely than others to show up over time. So if you're looking to increase your chances of winning in a roulette game, focusing on bets on odd numbers may be your best strategy.

#  American Roulette Favors Bankers

## The odds are in bankers' favor

American roulette, with its 38 pockets, provides a more favorable game for bankers than European roulette, with its 36 pockets. This is because the American wheel has two green pockets (0 and 00), while the European wheel has only one.

In any given spin of the wheel, the chances of the ball landing in a particular pocket are the same for both American and European wheels. However, over time, the addition of the 00 pocket on the American wheel gives bankers a bigger edge.

This is because when the ball lands in either of the two green pockets, players lose their bet regardless of what number it landed on. So while there is a 1/37 chance that any given number will come up on an American wheel, that chance increases to 1/38 when you include the green pockets.

The difference may seem small, but it can add up over time. In fact, over an infinite number of spins, bankers would expect to come out ahead by 2.7%.
