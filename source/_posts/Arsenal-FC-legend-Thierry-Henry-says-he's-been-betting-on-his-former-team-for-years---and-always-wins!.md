Arsenal FC legend Thierry Henry has revealed that he has been betting on his former team for years - and always wins!

The Frenchman, who is now a professional pundit and TV presenter, says that he bets on Arsenal to win every game - and has never lost.

"I've been betting on Arsenal to win every game for years now, and I've never lost," he said. "I know they're not always the most exciting team to watch, but I have complete faith in them. And it's always great when they manage to win."

Henry also played down suggestions that Arsenal are in a crisis, insisting that they will still finish in the top four this season.

"People are writing them off, but I don't think Arsenal are in a crisis," he said. "Yes, they had a bad run of form recently, but I'm sure they'll turn it around. They're still favourites to finish in the top four."

Injuries and suspensions can have a big impact on the outcome of a football match, so it’s important to stay up-to-date with the latest news. This way, you can make informed decisions about which teams to bet on.

4. Look at past performances

Arsenal FC has a history of success, but that doesn’t mean they always win - in fact, they sometimes lose games they should win. So it’s important to look at past performances before placing any bets. This will give you an idea of whether or not the current odds are favourable.
