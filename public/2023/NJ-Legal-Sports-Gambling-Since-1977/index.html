        <h1 id="NJ-Legal-Sports-Gambling-Since-1977"><a href="#NJ-Legal-Sports-Gambling-Since-1977" class="headerlink" title="NJ Legal Sports Gambling Since 1977"></a>NJ Legal Sports Gambling Since 1977</h1><p>New Jersey has been at the forefront of the sports betting industry for over 40 years. Although its legality has been called into question on a few occasions, there is no doubt that NJ-based casinos and racetracks have been taking sports bets since 1977. Here we take a closer look at New Jersey’s long history with legal sports gambling.</p>
<h1 id="The-Early-Days"><a href="#The-Early-Days" class="headerlink" title="The Early Days"></a>The Early Days</h1><p>New Jersey’s first foray into legal sports gambling came in the form of parlay cards. These small cards allowed players to bet on multiple sporting events at once, and they were offered at New Jersey’s racetracks and casinos. The popularity of parlay betting soon led to the development of more advanced betting options, including proposition bets and futures bets.</p>
<h1 id="The-Morrisey-Decision"><a href="#The-Morrisey-Decision" class="headerlink" title="The Morrisey Decision"></a>The Morrisey Decision</h1><p>In 2012, New Jersey Governor Chris Christie signed a bill into law that effectively legalized sports betting in the state. However, this law was challenged in court by the NCAA and four professional sports leagues (the NFL, MLB, NBA, and NHL). The case eventually made its way to the Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the leagues in 2018. This ruling effectively banned Sports Betting across the entire country, but it left the door open for states to legalize it themselves.</p>
<h1 id="The-Fight-Continues"><a href="#The-Fight-Continues" class="headerlink" title="The Fight Continues"></a>The Fight Continues</h1><p>Since the Supreme Court ruling, New Jersey has been hard at work trying to pass a new sports betting bill that would be compatible with federal law. In March 2019, state legislators introduced a new bill that would allow casinos and racetracks to offer sports betting online and through mobile apps. This bill is currently being debated in the state legislature, and it is unclear whether or not it will pass.</p>
<h1 id="Reyer-Venezia-The-Oldest-Legal-Sports-Book-In-NJ"><a href="#Reyer-Venezia-The-Oldest-Legal-Sports-Book-In-NJ" class="headerlink" title="Reyer Venezia The Oldest Legal Sports Book In NJ"></a>Reyer Venezia The Oldest Legal Sports Book In NJ</h1><p>The Reyer Venezia, in operation since at least 1909, is the oldest continuously-licensed sports book in the state of New Jersey. Located inside the Borgata casino in Atlantic City, it offers betting lines on all of the traditional North American sports – as well as many international leagues and events.</p>
<p>The Reyer Venezia is open 24 hours a day, seven days a week, 365 days a year. It has a staff of experienced oddsmakers who are always up-to-date on the latest news and injuries affecting each of the teams involved in the various sporting events. The casino also offers a wide variety of other gambling opportunities, including blackjack, roulette, poker, and slots.</p>
<p>In addition to its brick-and-mortar location at the Borgata casino, the Reyer Venezia also has an online presence at reyerveneziabetting.com. There you can place bets not only on traditional sporting events but also on entertainment markets such as who will win next year’s Academy Awards or which team will win this year’s Super Bowl.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a reputable and reliable sports book in which to make your bets, the Reyer Venezia is definitely worth checking out.</p>
<h1 id="NJ-Sports-Betting-History-How-Long-Has-It-Been-Legal"><a href="#NJ-Sports-Betting-History-How-Long-Has-It-Been-Legal" class="headerlink" title="NJ Sports Betting History: How Long Has It Been Legal?"></a>NJ Sports Betting History: How Long Has It Been Legal?</h1><p>In recent years, NJ sports betting has become a more popular topic, both in the state and around the country. This is in part due to the legalization of sports betting by some states, as well as the ongoing debate about whether or not it should be legalized on a national level.</p>
<p>While many people may be familiar with the basics of NJ sports betting, there are likely many who don’t know much about its history. In this article, we will take a look at how long NJ sports betting has been legal and some of the key moments along the way.</p>
<p>NJ Sports Betting History: How Long Has It Been Legal?</p>
<p>The first time that gambling was mentioned in New Jersey was in 1670, when a law was passed that prohibited lotteries. However, it wasn’t until 1978 that casinos were legalized in Atlantic City. This paved the way for NJ sports betting to become legal.</p>
<p>It wasn’t until 1993 that any type of sports betting was actually legalized in New Jersey. At this point, race tracks were allowed to offer parlay wagers on horse races. A few years later, in 1997, online sports betting was legalized in New Jersey.</p>
<p>One of the key moments in NJ sports betting history came in 2012, when Governor Chris Christie signed a bill that allowed residents to place bets on professional and college sports games. This was significant because it was the first time that residents could bet on sports other than horse races.</p>
<p>Since then, NJ sports betting has continued to grow in popularity. In fact, according to one study, more than $1 billion was wagered on sporting events through NJ online casinos and racetracks in 2018 alone.</p>
<h1 id="Reyer-Venezia-A-Legacy-In-NJ-Sports-Gambling"><a href="#Reyer-Venezia-A-Legacy-In-NJ-Sports-Gambling" class="headerlink" title="Reyer Venezia: A Legacy In NJ Sports Gambling"></a>Reyer Venezia: A Legacy In NJ Sports Gambling</h1><p>Reyer Venezia came to the United States in the early 1900s as an immigrant looking for a better life. What he found was a new home and a new passion – basketball.</p>
<p>He started his basketball career in 1920 with the Camden YMCA. The young, up-and-coming player quickly made a name for himself, and in 1922 he was recruited by the Reyer Venezia Club of Venice, Italy.</p>
<p>Reyer Venezia quickly became one of the best players in Europe, leading his team to numerous championships. In 1928 he was named the MVP of the Italian Basketball League.</p>
<p>In 1933 he retired from professional basketball and returned to the United States. He settled in New Jersey and opened a successful grocery store in Newark.</p>
<p>While living in New Jersey, Reyer Venezia remained close to the world of basketball. He often attended games at Madison Square Garden and spent time mentoring young players at local gyms.</p>
<p>It was during this time that Reyer Venezia began to be recognized as one of the pioneers of NJ sports gambling. He was one of the first people to bet on basketball games, and he often shared his insights with other gamblers around town.</p>
<p>Reyer Venezia passed away in 1957, but his legacy lives on in NJ sports gambling. His influence can still be seen in the way that people bet on games and in the excitement that surrounds collegiate and professional basketball in New Jersey.</p>
<h1 id="How-Long-Has-Sports-Wagering-Been-Legal-In-NJ"><a href="#How-Long-Has-Sports-Wagering-Been-Legal-In-NJ" class="headerlink" title="How Long Has Sports Wagering Been Legal In NJ?"></a>How Long Has Sports Wagering Been Legal In NJ?</h1><p>Revenue from sports betting in the United States is expected to top $4.2 billion in 2020, up from $1.8 billion this year, according to Eilers &amp; Krejcik Gaming, a research firm. </p>
<p>Legal sports betting has been around since the early 1990s in some states, including New Jersey. In 1993, the state legalized sports betting through its racetracks. The state’s casinos were added to the mix in 2013 and mobile sports betting in 2018. </p>
<p>The industry took off after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law called the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in May 2018, allowing states to legalize and regulate sports betting as they see fit. </p>
<p>So how long has legal sports gambling been around NJ? About 26 years!</p>
