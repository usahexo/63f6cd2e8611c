        <h1 id="Alabama’s-Line-Is-Getting-Stale"><a href="#Alabama’s-Line-Is-Getting-Stale" class="headerlink" title="Alabama’s Line Is Getting Stale"></a>Alabama’s Line Is Getting Stale</h1><p>Alabama has arguably the best offensive line in college football. However, with so many of the same players on the field for three years in a row, the unit is starting to look stale.</p>
<p>This was most glaringly evident in the Tide’s loss to Clemson in the national championship game. Clemson’s defensive front seven was able to exploit Alabama’s lack of depth and inexperience on the offensive line.</p>
<p>Alabama head coach Nick Saban is fully aware of this issue and plans to address it this offseason. He has already started by bringing in five-star freshman offensive lineman Elliot Kaiser.</p>
<p>The Tide also have several talented underclassmen who will be competing for playing time this fall. Offensive tackles Jedrick Wills and Alex Leatherwood are both early enrollees who will be looking to replace departed seniors Jonah Williams and Ross Pierschbacher.</p>
<p>Given Alabama’s track record, it is safe to say that they will find a way to reload their offensive line and stay competitive at the top of college football. However, there is no doubt that teams will be looking to take advantage of Alabama’s lack of experience up front next season.</p>
<h1 id="Is-Alabama’s-Line-The-Worst-In-Sports-Wagering"><a href="#Is-Alabama’s-Line-The-Worst-In-Sports-Wagering" class="headerlink" title="Is Alabama’s Line The Worst In Sports Wagering?"></a>Is Alabama’s Line The Worst In Sports Wagering?</h1><p>There is no denying that the Alabama Crimson Tide football team has one of the best programs in the country. But, when it comes to sports wagering, their line may be the worst.</p>
<p>Since 2009, they have failed to cover the point spread in more than half of their games. In addition, they are just 1-5 against the spread (ATS) in their last six matchups against rivals Auburn and LSU. This means that if you were to bet on them in these games, you would have lost money five out of six times.</p>
<p>Alabama is often a big favorite in games, so it can be tough to find value betting on them. However, there are some instances where they may be worth a small investment. In their game against Mississippi State earlier this season, they were only a 3.5-point favorite. Despite winning by 21 points, they failed to cover the spread. This suggests that there may be some value betting against them when they are big favorites.</p>
<p>One thing to keep in mind is that Alabama always has a chance to win big and cover the spread. So, if you are looking to bet on them, make sure you are doing so with caution.</p>
<h1 id="Alabama-Is-Afraid-To-Change-Their-Line"><a href="#Alabama-Is-Afraid-To-Change-Their-Line" class="headerlink" title="Alabama Is Afraid To Change Their Line"></a>Alabama Is Afraid To Change Their Line</h1><p>Alabama’s line has been one of the best in college football for what seems like forever. However, with their recent string of losses, there have been some calls for Alabama to make a change.</p>
<p>The issue is that Alabama doesn’t seem to want to shake things up. They’ve been trying different combinations at guard, but the results haven’t been great so far. The team still has three games left in the season, and they need to figure out something if they want to make a playoff run.</p>
<p>One possible solution is to move Jonah Williams over to guard. He played there earlier in his career, and he’s got the athleticism to make the switch. Another option is to bring in someone new, but that would be a huge risk given how well the current line has been playing.</p>
<p>No matter what Alabama decides to do, they need to make a change soon. The current lineup isn’t working, and it could end up costing them a chance at the national championship.</p>
<h1 id="Alabama’s-Line-Might-As-Well-Be-A-Sure-Bet"><a href="#Alabama’s-Line-Might-As-Well-Be-A-Sure-Bet" class="headerlink" title="Alabama’s Line Might As Well Be A Sure Bet"></a>Alabama’s Line Might As Well Be A Sure Bet</h1><p>Alabama’s offensive line is scary good. They have size, strength, and experience. They are a unit that can pave the way for a successful ground game and protect their quarterback.</p>
<p>The Crimson Tide lost their left tackle, Cam Robinson, to the NFL draft, but they still have one of the best offensive lines in the country. Jonah Williams is moving from right to left tackle. He is a freshman, but coaches have confidence in him. Ross Pierschbacher moves from guard to center. He is also a freshman, but he has plenty of experience playing in big games. The other three starters are returnees- Bradley Bozeman at center, Lester Cotton at guard, and Matt Womack at right tackle.</p>
<p>These five players have started a total of 103 games. That kind of experience is hard to find. They know how to play together and they know what it takes to win.</p>
<p>The offensive line will be tested in the season opener against Florida State on September 2nd. The Seminoles have a good defensive line that includes DEs DeMarcus Walker and Josh Sweat. It will be interesting to see how the Alabama linemen handle this challenge.</p>
<p>They will also be tested in later games against Auburn and LSU. Both of these teams have excellent defensive linemen who can cause problems for an offense.</p>
<p>The Alabama offensive line is not just good- they are one of the best units in the country. They will be key to the team’s success this season.</p>
<h1 id="What’s-Wrong-With-Alabama’s-Line"><a href="#What’s-Wrong-With-Alabama’s-Line" class="headerlink" title="What’s Wrong With Alabama’s Line?"></a>What’s Wrong With Alabama’s Line?</h1><p>Alabama’s offensive line was once a point of strength for the team. However, in recent years the line has shown some clear weaknesses. Last season, the Crimson Tide’s line allowed 39 sacks, more than any other team in the nation. In order to address this issue, Alabama revamped its offensive line this offseason.</p>
<p>The biggest change came at center, where Ryan Kelly replaced Barrett Jones. Jones had been a mainstay on Alabama’s offensive line for the past four seasons and was a Rimington Trophy finalist last year. However, he struggled mightily in pass protection last season, allowing nine sacks. Kelly, on the other hand, is known for his athleticism and his ability to get to the second level of the defense.</p>
<p>Alabama also made changes to its left and right tackle positions. Arie Kouandjio moved from right guard to right tackle, while Cyrus Kouandjio moved from left tackle to left guard. This move was made in order to improve the team’s run blocking ability. Alabama’s running backs averaged just 3.9 yards per carry last season, which was ninth-worst in the nation.</p>
<p>So far this preseason, Alabama’s revamped offensive line has looked solid. In their first scrimmage, they didn’t allow a single sack and they helped the Crimson Tide rush for 326 yards. However, it remains to be seen if they will be able to perform as well against SEC defenses.</p>
